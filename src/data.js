      webDesc: "I developed a full-stack application accessible on the web, Play Store, and App Store. As the sole developer, I managed all aspects of the application's development, deployment, and maintenance. My responsibilities included creating a seamless user signup process for individuals to register animals for events hosted by other users. Additionally, I implemented a secure payment portal that allowed users to subscribe and make one-time payments using Stripe's API. To enhance payment tracking and management, I integrated webhooks, enabling real-time communication with our server. These efforts significantly contributed to the company's increased profitability.",
